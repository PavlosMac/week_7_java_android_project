# week_7_java_android_project

Brief was to:
- using an OOP approach make a two player top-trumps card game
- winner should have highest ranking hand
- display game-play on android using android studio. 
- shuffle and re-deal to repeat the game-play

MVP met in week deadline.
Possible to scale if desired.
